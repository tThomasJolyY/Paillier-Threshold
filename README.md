# Paillier-Threshold


This repo contains the backend of a website demonstrating the use and security of Paillier's cryptosystem.
The website's frontend git : https://github.com/uvsq21919161/Vote_securise


The website is not available anymore sadly :/


To compensate, here are some screenshots of what it looked like :
